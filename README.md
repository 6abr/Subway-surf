### Repo details
**Important: I tried using File manager+ on my Android 13 phone, and I couldn't able to use, so if you have Android 13 You may not able to use File manager+ so you can't expl0it**

**BUT**

**On my Android 12 Tablet, the File manager+ worked perfectly, so if you have Android 12, then you won't have any issue**

if somehow you can't open the files there is links for characters_inventory.json: https://pastebin.com/raw/EE12BRHn and for boards_inventory.json: https://pastebin.com/raw/8pCQf1dx
